<h1>2.Lake Hillier</h1>

<h2>The reason of its unique colour is still a topic that is not fully understood by </br>
scientists, although most suspect it has to do with the presence of the Dunaliella </br>
salina microalgae. The Dunaliella produces carotenoids, a pigment found in carrots</br>
 as well. But the presence of halophilic bacteria in the salt crusts could be another </br>
explanation. A reaction between the salt and the sodium bicarbonate that is found </br>
in the water may cause it as well.</h2>

<img src="wave.jpg" width="700">
<h2>Located near the Wheatbelt town of Hyden, is one of Australia’s most recognisable</br>
landforms.Rising 15 metres from the ground and more than 100 metres long, the rock </br>
looks like a giant surf wave of multicoloured granite about to crash onto the bush below. </br>
It’s believed this amazing formation was more than 2,700 million years in the making.</br>
Take a bush walk around the rock to see native flowers and birds. The rock also plays </br>
host to a popular music festival each year in spring.</h2>
