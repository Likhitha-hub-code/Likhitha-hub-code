<h2>Niagara Falls, waterfall on the Niagara River in northeastern North America,
 one of the continentâ€™s most famous spectacles.<br>
 The falls lie on the border between Ontario, Canada, and New York state,
U.S. For many decades the falls were an <br>attraction for honeymooners and for
such stunts as walking over the falls on a tightrope or going over them in a barrel.<br>
 Increasingly, however, the appeal of the site has become its beauty and uniqueness as
a physical phenomenon.

<h2>Between late September and late March, Northern Norway is dark from early afternoon <br>
until late morning, and the northern lights frequently soar across the sky. <br>
Our bold claim is that this part of Norway, with its multiple islands, deep fjords and <br> steep mountains,
is among the worlds most beautiful and interesting places to see the northern lights.
