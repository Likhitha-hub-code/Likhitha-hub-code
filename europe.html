<h2>
Kirkjufell, or 'Church Mountain', is a distinctly shaped peak found on the north shore <br>
of Iceland’s Snæfellsnes Peninsula, only a short distance away from the town of <br>
Grundarfjörður. It is often called ‘the most photographed mountain in celand’ due to<br>
 its dramatic formation and perfect coastal location.</h2>

<h2>Visit Kirkjufell on a tour of the Snaefellsnes Peninsula. The landmark is <br>
incorporated into many self-drive packages, such as this 10-Day Summer Trip, and <br>
vacation packages, such as this 6-Day Winter Tour. Those who rent a car can seek it
out while exploring the west.

<h2>Kirkjufell takes its name from its resemblance to a church steeple, sharpened<br>
at the top with long curved sides. From other angles, the mountain has been compared<br>
 to a witch’s hat or even a freshly scooped ice cream.On top of that, the colours of <br>
Kirkjufell change with the passing seasons;the summer sees it a lush green, full of life, <br>
whilst the winter months scar the mountain’s face with a mask of barren brown and white.<br>
 Of course, it is more impressive under the midnight sun in the weeks surrounding the <br>
June equinox,and under the northern lights, best seen between September and April.<br></h2>
