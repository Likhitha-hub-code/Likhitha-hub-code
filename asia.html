<h2>The Committee inscribed Lake Baikal as the most outstanding example of <br>
a freshwater ecosystem on the basis of natrual criteria (vii), (viii), (ix) and (x). <br>
It is the oldest and deepest of the world´s lakes containing nearly 20% of the <br>
world´s unfrozen freshwater reserve. The lake contains an outstanding variety of <br>
endemic flora and fauna, which is of exceptional value to evolutionary science. <br>
It is also surrounded by a system of protected areas that have high scenic and <br>
other natural values. The Committee took note of the confirmation of the revised <br>
boundaries of the site, which correspond to the core areas defined in the Baikal <br>
Law (excluding the five urban developed areas). It also noted that the special Lake<br>
Baikal Law is now in its second reading in the Duma. Finally, it noted concern over <br>
a number of integrity issues including pollution, which should be brought to the attention<br>
of the Russian authorities.</h2>
