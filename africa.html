<h2>Victoria Falls is the only waterfall in the world with a length of more than <br>
a kilometer and a height of more than hundred meters. It is also considered to be <br>
the largest fall in the world.
The noise of Victoria Falls can be heard from a distance of 40 kilometers, while the <br>
spray and mist from the falling water is rising to a height of over 400 meters and can<br>
 be seen from a distance of 50 kilometers. No wonder that the local tribes used to <br>
call the waterfall Mosi-o-Tunya “The smoke that thunders”.

<h2>Kilimanjaro is not only Africa’s tallest peak, but also the world’s tallest free <br>
standing mountain. The summit, named Uhuru Point, is 5,895 meters (19,341 feet)<br>
 above sea level.<br>

Most high mountains are part of ranges, such as Mount Everest’s Himalayan <br>
Mountain Range. These are formed in a process called plate tectonics. Below the<br>
ground, Earth’s crust is made up of multiple tectonic plates. These plates have <br>
been moving since the beginning of time due to geologic activity</h2>

<h2>Lake Malawi/Lake Nyasa is an African Great Lake – the southernmost lake <br>
in the East African Rift system. It is the fifth-largest freshwater lake in the world <br>
(by volume) and the third-largest in Africa (behind Lake Victoria and Lake <br>
Tanganyika). The lake is around 570km in length and some 75km at its widest <br>
point, with one central depression extending to a depth of over 700m. <br>
(If this doesn’t fully put things into perspective, Lake Malawi holds an estim<br>ated
7% of the world’s available surface freshwater.) It lies between Mozambique, <br>
Malawi and Tanzania and the exact position of the international boundary between<br>
Malawi and Tanzania remains a matter of considerable contention that has boiled <br>
over into frequent diplomatic skirmishes.<br>
